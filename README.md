# MechShooterGame

These are some scripts for a Mech Shooter game in Unreal Engine 5.

The "MechActors" folder contains the main scripts for the player and enemies.
The Script named "Lothair" contains the main functionality of the player mech but the attack logic has not been added to the tick function so you may
add it as you like.
The scripts do require assets for models and animations.

The Script name "Mechbase" holds the base functionality for all mechs.

The "AI" folder and "Chaos" folder contain logic for AI mech functionality and chaos destructable buildings.
